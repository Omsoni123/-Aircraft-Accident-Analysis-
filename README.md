# ✈️ Aircraft Accident Analysis – Power BI + Python Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the deadliest aircraft accidents using data scraped from multiple websites. I structured, cleaned, and analyzed this data to uncover key patterns in aviation failures.

## 🚀 What I Did
- 🔎 Collected raw data from various sources using **Python (Selenium & Pandas)**
- 🧹 Cleaned and structured messy text data
- 🧠 Extracted new features like crash cause (collision, fire, system failure)
- 💾 Saved processed data into CSV for analysis
- 🛠️ Used **SQL** for deeper data exploration and KPI extraction
- 📊 Built a dynamic **Power BI dashboard** showing:
  - Year-wise crash trends
  - Survival rate patterns
  - Aircraft/company-wise fatalities
  - Filters for Year, Country, Crash Reason

## 🎯 Objective
To help civilians understand trends in airline safety and provide transparent insights into aviation history through creative data storytelling.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Apply **machine learning clustering** to group similar accidents
- Deploy an interactive survival prediction model
